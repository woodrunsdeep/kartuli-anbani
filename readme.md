# Kartuli Anbani (i.e. Georgian Alphabet)

An app that helps you memorize georgian alphabet by using spaced repetition method.

Recently I moved to Georgia and had decided to learn the language of the country I plan to stay for a while.
Even though a lot of people in Georgia know English and Russian it's always better to speak with locals on their native language.

So the first step (as with any language) is the alphabet.
Since I learn frontend web development I thought about building an app for learning the georgian alphabet from scratch.
It will help me (and maybe you as well!) pick up new skills in both areas (frontend and foreign language) simultaneously.

This is a work in progress and I'm a beginner frontend developer so don't judge too harshly :)
I will appreciate any feedback from anyone and will try to improve accordingly.

Available in Russian (English comming soon)
